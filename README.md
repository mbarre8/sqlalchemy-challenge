# sqlalchemy-challenge

In the following challenge I created query sessions using SQLAlchemy to analyze a dataset provide in a sqlite database. I was able to identify two classes in the database and placed the classes into tables to further look at precipitation and stations. All analysis for this section was comepleted in jupyter notebook using pandas, numpy, datetime, sqlalchemy, and matplotlib libraries.
Once I completed the initial analysis, I used Visual Studio Code and flask to create a climate app. I setup the database connection, Flask, and flask routes. Furthermore app routes were created from precipitation, stations, overall temperature observations and temperature obsverations for specific start and start/end dates with api links displaying results in a json structure.
In order to complete this challenage I referenced class activities in module 10, stack overflow pages and flask reference documents.
